# Purpose 

Have you ever struggled to figure out what you should watch with your friends? CineMatch will help pair you and your friends with the perfect film or show to watch. Users can join sessions with their friends, and the app has a swiping interface (similar to a dating app) for determining the optimal title to watch.


# Implementation 

CineMatch is a cross-platform, mobile first application. This guided our design decision from the onset as we were hoping to replicate the UI/UX of a dating app (and we largely succeeded at that goal). The app deploys natively to iOS and Android, and can also be run from [CineMatch.xyz](https://cinematch.xyz) either in-browser or as a progressive-web app, providing a standalone native like experience for those unable to install the app from the app store. This was also deliberate, as it will help us quickly distribute the app during the VTHacks Demo.

The app was built using Flutter as the front-end and Google Firebase Firestore as our back-end / database. We chose this suite because we believed by staying in the Google Cloud ecosystem it would make for a more positive developer experience.


# Future Steps 

* A more robust explore page. Right now, users can explore our entire catalog of content on the homepage however it would be nice if that page provided more information and search functionality
* Social networking - like Venmo for movies, be able to see what your other groups of friends are deciding to watch
* Mapping - see what others around the world are watching on a nice map!

# Try it Out

To try out our app, we encourage you to install Flutter and try the app locally or check out our [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/PAgF9TyMdqkvPazXWkjWPo/Application?node-id=40%3A135&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1) for a simulated expereince!
